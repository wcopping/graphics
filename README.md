I followed the vulkan tutorial at https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ for the
following two directories: vulkan-triangle, tutorial-beyond-ch19

The tutorial is great and I recommend it to anyone learning about Vulkan or
graphics in general as the entire initial set up of Vulkan is one giant lesson
on the different stages of getting graphics on the screen anyway.

The tutorial at learnopengl.com was used for the learn-opengl directory. It is
written by Joey De Vries and is recommend to anyone looking into graphics.
I also recommend the video serious by TheChernoProject on YouTube. He provides
a wonderful verbal teaching of fundamental concepts of Graphics/OpenGL.
